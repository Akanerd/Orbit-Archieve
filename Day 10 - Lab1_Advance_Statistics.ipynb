    "## **Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "***\n",
    "Hypothesis testing or significance testing is a statistical method for testing a claim or hypothesis about a parameter in a population, using data measured in a sample.\n",
    "Hypothesis Testing is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter. E.g., Average marks obtained by students is 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to follow in Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.\tState the hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two parameters here: Null Hypothesis and Alternate Hypothesis.\n",
    "The Null Hypothesis assumes that there is no relation between two variables i.e., one variable has no effect on another variable. The Null Hypothesis is a basic assumption made based on domain or problem knowledge.\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis used in hypothesis testing that is contrary to the null hypothesis.\n",
    "NOTE: If the null hypothesis is rejected, then we accept the alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, then we do not accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.\tSet the criteria for a decision**\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the criteria for a decision, we state the level of significance for a test.\n",
    "Confidence level is something that how confident we are regarding the given statement. Generally, we won’t be 100% sure so it will be less than 100%. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Level of significance:\n",
    "        Refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null-hypothesis. Level of significance is denoted by α.\n",
    "        α= 1-confidence level\n",
    "\n",
    "   One Tail Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "        A test of a statistical hypothesis, where the region of rejection is on only one side of the sampling distribution, is called a one-tailed test.\n",
    "        Ex:  Average marks of students <= 40\n",
    "\n",
    "   Two-tailed test:\n",
    "\n",
    "        A two-tailed test is a statistical test in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values. If the sample being tested falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted instead of the null hypothesis.\n",
    "        Example: Average marks of students! = 40 students\n",
    "\n",
    "   p-value:\n",
    "\n",
    "        A p value is used in hypothesis testing to help you support or reject the null hypothesis. The p value is the evidence against a null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: If your P value is less than the chosen significance level then you reject the null hypothesis i.e., accept that your sample gives reasonable evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.**\n",
